               <h1>About Us</h1>

                    <p>At YogSec, we help businesses build secure, resilient, and trustworthy digital products. In today’s fast-moving online world, security is no longer optional-it’s a foundation for growth. Our mission is simple: identify real-world vulnerabilities before attackers do and help organizations fix them with clarity and confidence.</p>
                    <p>Founded by a security researcher and bug bounty hunter, YogSec was built with an attacker’s mindset and a defender’s responsibility. We focus on practical, hands-on web application security, not just automated scans or generic reports. Every assessment we perform is driven by real attack scenarios, proven methodologies, and industry best practices.</p>
                    <p>We work with startups, SaaS companies, small businesses, and growing enterprises that want to protect their websites, APIs, and user data. Whether you’re launching a new product, scaling your platform, or handling sensitive customer information, YogSec provides security solutions that fit your business stage and risk profile.</p>
                    <p>Our services include web application penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, security audits, and remediation guidance. We go beyond finding issues-we explain their impact in clear business terms and guide your team on how to fix them efficiently. Our goal is not to overwhelm you with technical jargon, but to help you make informed security decisions.</p>
                    <p>What sets YogSec apart is our research-driven approach. We stay actively involved in vulnerability research, bug bounty programs, and real-world exploitation techniques. This ensures our testing reflects how attackers actually think and operate, not just how tools behave.</p>
                    <p>We believe security should be transparent, ethical, and growth-focused. That’s why we follow responsible disclosure practices, respect client confidentiality, and tailor every engagement to your specific needs. No one-size-fits-all plans—only security that makes sense for your business.</p>
